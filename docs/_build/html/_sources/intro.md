# Accessing WRDS Datasets

Wharton Research Data Services (**WRDS**) offers a multitude of ways to access the datasets they host, such as:

* Web Query Forms through the [Online Platform](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu)
* [WRDS SAS Studio](https://wrds-cloud.wharton.upenn.edu/SASStudio/index?locale=en_US) 
* [WRDS R Studio](https://wrds-rstudio.wharton.upenn.edu/auth-sign-in?appUri=%2F) 
* [WRDS JupyterHub](https://wrds-jupyter.wharton.upenn.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) 
* [The WRDS Cloud](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/grid-items/accessing-wrds-cloud/)
* Various package libraries that allow you to connect to WRDS from your computer

To seamlessly integrate your **WRDS** queries into your research workflow, you can access the **WRDS** API from Python with the [`wrds`](https://pypi.org/project/wrds/) package, or from R with the [`RPostgres`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgres/index.html) library.

Both of these tool will enable you to connect to **WRDS** anywhere including **KLC** or your own computer. 

In this session, we'll cover:

- (1) Setting up your access credentials
- (2) Exploring Databases and Tables 
- (3) Running a Sample Project
